/*

The IC has 2 means of communicating, RF/NFC and I2C.
both the RF interface (the actual NFC functionality) and the I2C interface are all about memory access.
There are 2 memory maps, with some significant overlapping areas, which can change depending on the mode (normal, pass-through, mirror)
for the comprehensive (and suprisingly legible) memory map tables, please look at page 12/13 (RF) and 14/15 (I2C) of the datasheet.
the datasheet talks about blocks (16 bytes) and pages (4 bytes). The I2C interface uses in blocks, the RF interface uses sectors and pages.

The IC has 2 types of memory; EEPROM and SRAM (see page 16 of the datasheet)
by default, the RF interface only has access to the EEPROM, but with Memory-Mirror mode or Pass-Through modes, it can access SRAM as well.
The EEPROM has a limited number of write(/read) cycles, so to keep that in mind
The SRAM has "unlimited" write/read cycles, but is only 64 bytes

The IC has a number of features/contents (which i explain in more detail further below):
- I2C address changing (by NFC host or I2C master)
- Serial number
- Static & Dynamic locking: turns memory to read-only (can only be set/reset by I2C host)
- Capability Container (CC): set (factory-programmed) according to the 'NFC Forum Type 2 Tag specification', used to indicate memory version, memory size and R/W access
- Configuration and Session registers: communication settings. These values are loaded into the session registers on Power-On-Reset (Conf. is stored in EEPROM, Sess. is read-only for RF)
- Pass-through mode: lets the NFC host and I2C master talk (almost) directly (through a 64byte buffer)
- Memory-Mirror mode: lets you map the (64byte) SRAM overtop a part of the EEPROM, to save write(/read) cycles
- Field Detection pin: can be set to react to certain events with a rising and/or falling edge. Pretty nice if you want to save I2C bus time (at the cost of 1 GPIO pin)
- Watchdog timer: in case the I2C master forgets to indicate that it's done using the memory, the WDT will clear the I2C_LOCKED flag (letting the RF access the memory)

The I2C interface of the NT3H is somewhat complex
The I2C address can be changed (only by I2C master) but by default it's:
0b1010101x = 0xAA / 0xAB  including the R/W bit,
0b01010101 = 0x55  in the unshifted (conventional) way.
you can modify the I2C address, but only through the I2C address (so you can't really have 2 devices on 1 bus).
the I2C clock freq can be 100kHz or 400kHz (not sure about arbetrary values inbetween or below)

Both read and write operations are done in 16 byte (not bit!) blocks, with a MEMory Address (MEMA) byte prefix
meaning that there are 256 blocks of 16 bytes, for a total of 4096 bytes of addressable space.
for (normal) operations, the read/write structure must look like:
 for reads: you send the memory block address, then a stop and start conditions, then read 16 bytes
 for writes:  you send the memory block address, then 16 bytes of data
ONLY the registers block is accessed in the following 1-byte fashion:
 for reads: you send the 0xFE block, then 1 byte (which of the register bytes (0~7) you want), then a stop and start conditions, then read 1 byte
 for writes:  you send the 0xFE block, then 1 byte (which of the register bytes (0~7) you want), then a bitmask for which bits to affect, then the new register byte.
  (the mask byte is nice, cuz then you don't have to read the byte first, you can just exclusively target the settings you want without affecting others)
The IC includes an optional soft-reset feature, if you perform a repeated-start. The default is 0 (presumably that means disabled), so repeated starts don't reset the IC

Communication and arbitration between RF and IÂ²C interface:
both the RF interface (the actual NFC functionality) and the I2C interface are all about memory access.
 However, ONLY 1 interface can have access at-a-time.
So, the I2C code should check whether the RF interface is using the memory, by checking RF_LOCKED bit in the NS_REG register



feature descriptions:

Serial Number (UID):
(the Serial Number bytes are found at (I2C)block:0x00,bytes:0~6  == (RF)sector:0,page:0x00,byte:0~page:0x01,byte:6 )
the serial number is a 7byte value at memory address 0x00~0x07, the first byte of which is always the NXP manufacturer ID, 0x04.
 This first constant byte SHARES a memory address with the I2C address byte, so reads and writes of that byte are entirely unrelated

ATQA and SAK:
(the SAK byte is found at (I2C)block:0x00,byte:7  == (RF)sector:0,page:0x01,byte:3 )
(the ATQA bytes are found at (I2C)block:0x00,bytes:8~9  == (RF)sector:0,page:0x02,bytes:0~1 )
These are some value to help identify the card (in this tag's case only(?) the Serial Number size)
Bits 6 and 7 (starting at 0, not 1) indicate the size of the Serial Number (7 bytes in this tag).
See page 40 of the datasheet for slightly more info (but not a lot... it's not exactly well-documented)

Static Locking (and block-locking):
(the static locking bytes are found at (I2C)block:0x00,bytes:10~11  == (RF)sector:0,page:0x02,bytes:2~3 )
memory space (I2C)block:0x01  == (RF)sector:0,page:0x03~0x0F can be locked as read-only memory using the Static locking bytes. (NOTE: total of 52 bytes)
(the rest of the memory can be locked using Dynamic Locking)
using bits[7:3] of the first static-lock-byte and bits[7:0] of the second byte, memory pages can be locked.
However, the static locking bytes themselves can also be locked ('block-locking'), by bits [2:0] of the first static-lock-byte.
this secondary locking seems a little excessive to me, personally, but whatever.
The RF interface cannot set locking bits back to 0, so Static Locking is a way for the I2C interface to limit the NFC host
For details on which bits block which memory pages, please refer to the helpful infograpic on page 17 of the datasheet

Dynamic Locking (and block-locking):
(the Dynamic locking bytes are found at (I2C)block:0x38/0x78,bytes:0~2  == (RF)sector:1,page:0xE2/0xE0,bytes:0~2)
Dynamic locking is the same as Static locking, just on a larger scale. It also has block-locking, for which the whole 3rd byte is used.
memory space to be locked as read-only memory using the Dynamic locking bytes. (NOTE: total of 840/1856) (datasheet has typo):
  on 1k variant: (I2C)block:0x02~block:0x56,bytes:0~7  == (RF)sector:0,page:0x10~0xE1                   == 210 pages == 52 blocks
  on 2k variant: (I2C)block:0x02~0x77                  == (RF)sector:0,page:0x10~sector:1,page:0xDF     == 464 pages == 116 blocks
(the first few bytes of the memory can be locked using Static Locking)
Usage is also very similar to Static Locking,
 EXCEPT that certain bits "marked with RFUI" must be set to 0 at all times.
Lastly, reading the 3rd byte will always return 0. No reason why, it's just true
For details on which bits block which memory pages, please refer to the helpful infograpic on page 18/19 of the datasheet

Capability Container (CC):  (also mentioned as 'NDEF management' in official NFC tag specification documents)
these are some bytes, defined by the NFC forum to help indicate what this particular tag can/can't do.
byte:0 is an absolute constant 0xE1  (to identify it as an official NFC forum complient card)
byte:1 indicates the version of the NFC specification the tag is built for.
  This particular IC uses version 0x10 (MSB nibble = major version, LSB nibble = minor version, V1.0 == 0b 0001 0000 )
byte:2 indicates the memory size of the tag (roughly?), multiply this byte with 8 to get size in bytes
byte:3 indicates read/write access.
  The MSB nibble is read access: 0x0 is default (unprotected), 0x1~7 are 'reserved for future use', 0x8~E are 'proprietary', 0xF i don't know
  The LSB nibble is write access: 0x_0 is default (unprotected), 0x_1~7 are 'reserved for future use', 0x_8~E are 'proprietary', 0x_F means NO WRITE ACCESS at all
the RF host can set certain bits, but it can't clear them (i think?). The I2C interface has more control (i think.)
There is no real need to mess with these bytes, except for indicating a lack of write-access (by writing 0x0F to the last byte)

Configuration and Session registers:
(the Configuration registers are found at (I2C)block:0x3A/0x7A,bytes:0~7  == (RF)sector:0/1,page:0xE8~0xE9)
(the Session registers are found at (I2C)block:0xFE,bytes:0~7  == (RF)sector:3,page:0xF8~0xF9) AND can only be accessed using a special read/write format (see pages 37~38 of datasheet)
Configuration registers are stored in EEPROM, and loaded into the Session registers at Power-On-Reset
Here is a list of the registers and their functions: {text in curvy{} brackets means ONLY for Session regs.}, [text in square[] brackets means only for Configuration regs.]
- NC_REG: I2C soft reset, {Pass-Through mode}, FD pin output, {Memory-Mirror mode}, data transfer direction (in Pass-Through mode) or RF write access (when not in Pass-Through mode)
- LAST_NDEF_BLOCK: address of last block (== 16 bytes == 4 pages) of user-memory that holds actual data. You set this to limit size that the RF host reads. (it basically indicates memory fullness)
- SRAM_MIRROR_BLOCK: address of first block of user-memory to be replaced (mapped over) by SRAM when Mirror-Mode is enabled
- WDT_LS and WDT_MS: watchdog time control register (NOTE: write _LS first??, becuase _MS activates something, i think)
- I2C_CLOCK_STR: I2C clock stretching enable/disable
- [REG_LOCK: disallow RF and/or I2C to write to the configuration bytes, NOTE: these bits BURN IN PERMANENTLY]
- {NS_REG: status flags for: RF done reading, memory arbitration (I2C vs RF), Pass-Through mode buffers filled, EEPROM write error or busy, RF field present}

Pass-Through mode explenation:
(Memory-Mirror must be OFF and requires external VCC)
when pass-through mode is enabled, the RF interface (NFC host) has access to the SRAM instead of(?) the EEPROM
the I2C interface always has access to the SRAM, so (by carefully coordinating reads and writes,) full custom communication between the RF host and I2C master is possible,
 using this IC's SRAM as a buffer inbetween. The SRAM buffer is 16 pages of 4 bytes, a.k.a. 64 bytes, which encompasses the entire SRAM block
using the SRAM requires external VCC (not only power harvesting), and must be re-enabled after every Power-On-Reset
pages 55~57 of the datasheet have some nice visuals for the state of the arbitration bits during pass-through mode.
...

Memory-Mirror mode explenation:
(pass-through must be OFF and requires external VCC)
While this mode is enabled, the SRAM is mapped overtop of a chunk of user-memory.
Bascially, if you want to vary one 64 byte chunk of the EEPROM very often, uses this mode.
The RF interface (and the I2C interface, i think) will interact with the SRAM instead of the EEPROM for a 64 byte chunk, thereby saving you precious EEPROM write(/read) cycles.
you can 'place' this chunk of anywhere in user-memory that you want, using SRAM_MIRROR_BLOCK in the Conf./Sess. registers

Field Detection pin: (they consider it 'active' LOW)
the FD pin can be activated (fall) by:
- RF field present
- start of communication (presumably triggers before anticollision (multiple tags)????)
- this tag being selected (not sure what the difference between this and communication start are...)
- (in Pass-Through mode) data in buffer: ready-to-be-read-by-I2C OR has-been-read-by-RF
and it can be deactivated (rise) by:
- RF field gone
- (RF field gone or) tag is set to HALT state
- (RF field gone or) last block of data has been read (defined by LAST_NDEF_BLOCK)
- (in Pass-Through mode and FD_ON set to indicate data buffer ready) (RF field gone or) data in buffer: has-been-read-by-I2C OR ready-to-be-read-by-RF

Watchdog timer:
(requires external VCC))
When the I2C master is using the memory, the I2C_LOCKED flag is TRUE
HOWEVER, the I2C master should also clear this flag once it's done all it wanted to.
So, in case the I2C master forgets to clear the flag, the WDT will do it for you.
The resolution is 9.43us, and the default value = 0x0848 == 2120*9.43us =~ 20ms
the maximum WDT value is 0xFFFF == 65535*9.43 =~ 618ms
if the WDT is triggered (timer is done), but the I2C interface is still actively communicating, it will clear the flag immediately afterwards

Energy harvesting:
The datasheet claims this IC can typically provide 5mA at 2V on the VOUT pin (when the NFC host is a phone).


the 2kb EEPROM can come from several places
file system (R/W) capable MCUs:
- ESP32
- STM32?
SD card (R/W) capable MCUs:
- all
big ass array (write only) capable MCUs:
- all (except MSP430 has very little ROM)
I'd like to make functions that properly encompass all of these, including:
suspending the WDT while writing such big files,
setting the LAST_NDEF_BLOCK to match the size of the loaded contents,



TO check out:
- responds to I2C general call?
- does checking the SRAM_xxx_READY flags clear them?
- FD pin start of comm vs tag selection
- soft reset function

TODO (general):
- connection check and I2C address change(?!?)
- continue writing missing functions (see list below)
- HW testing (STM32)
- HW testing (ESP32)
- HW testing (MSP430)
- HW testing (328p)
- block writing/reading to/from file/flash/EEPROM/idk   (2kB of data coming from somewhere, going to somewhere!)
- check Wire.h function return values for I2C errors
- test if 'static' vars in the ESP32 functions actually are static (connect 2 sensors?)

TO write (specific functions):
- set/get Session registers
- set/get configuration registers AND copy session registers data to configuration registers (store it in EEPROM)
- set/get watchdog timer setting (easy)
- set/get FD pin function
- (file writing funtion (mostly setting LAST_NDEF_BLOCK))
- static lock functions (_setStaticLockBits, staticLockPage, _staticBlockLockPageToChunk, staticBlockLockChunks)
- dynamic lock functions (_setDynamicLockBits, _dynamicLockPageToChunk, dynamicLockChunks, _dynamicBlockLockPageToChunk, dynamicBlockLockChunks)
- generalized lock function: lockArea(startBlock,endBlock,roundUp=true)
- Memory-Mirror mode functions
- Pass-Through mode functions
- check ATQA bytes to verify UID size
